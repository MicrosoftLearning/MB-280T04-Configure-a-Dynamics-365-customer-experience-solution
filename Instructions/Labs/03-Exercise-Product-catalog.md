# Exercise 2: Configure the product catalog

## Scenario: Contoso Home Security 
Contoso Home Security is a direct-to-consumer home security equipment and monitoring company. Their products include smart doorbells, smart thermostats, security systems, moisture sensors, and more. Since they are direct to consumer, their products are sold either online or in their retail stores across 11 major US cities. Online customers are assigned an account representative. Their role is to follow up with the customer and attempt to provide them with additional products and services. 

## The Contoso product catalog
Contoso home security sells a variety of products and services. These are automatically added to deals so pricing can be calculated based the prices of the specific items each customer needs.
