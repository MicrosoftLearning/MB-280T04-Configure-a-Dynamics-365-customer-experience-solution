# Applied Workshop: Configure a Dynamics 365 customer experience solutiion

The applied workshop portion if the MB-280 course is designed to help students apply the skills they have learned throughout the course to a real-world style example. The scenario has a variety of different elements included that span across Dynamics 365 Sales, Customer Insights - Journeys, and Customer Insights – Data. 

Based on the scenario provided below, you will create and configure your Dynamics 365 environment to meet the requirements outlined in the scenario. It is important to note that you don’t necessarily need to solve all the items addressed. Due to the amount of time allotted and what is included, you might only be able to address some of the items – which is okay and by design. 

**Important:** There is not necessarily a right or wrong way to accomplish this. Based on the criteria outlined in the scenario, you should produce and configure a solution based on how you see leveraging the different elements together.

At the end of the day, we will provide each student with 5 to 10 minutes to walk through part or all the solutions they created. 

## Time management 

You have the entire day (6.5 hours) to complete all aspects of this assignment. Review all the expectations first, then begin to manage your time. Phase 1 is designed to be a small group discussion; however, if you are working solo, then take the time to brainstorm on your own to help you with the rest of the assignment. Most of your time should be spent in Phases 2 and 3. Your instructor will let you know when to start Phase 4, but plan for it to take about an hour of your time.

Plan for the following:
- **Phase 1:**  Small group discussion
- **Phase 2:**  Design your solution
- **Phase 3:** Build your solution
- **Phase 4:** Share and compare your solutions


### Phase 1: Small group discussion

Discuss with your small group how to design the solution. Have a brainstorming session about how you might approach the solution to solve the organization’s business requirements.

### Phase 2: Design your solution

### Phase 3: Build your solution

### Phase 4: Share and compare your solution
<!-- Good practice - especially as self-paced learners will be using their own subscriptions -->
<!-- Delete this section if it is not needed -->

Now that you've finished the exercise, you should delete the cloud resources you've created to avoid unnecessary resource usage.
