# Exercise 3: Design a campaign

## Scenario: Contoso Home Security 
Contoso Home Security is a direct-to-consumer home security equipment and monitoring company. Their products include smart doorbells, smart thermostats, security systems, moisture sensors, and more. Since they are direct to consumer, their products are sold either online or in their retail stores across 11 major US cities. Online customers are assigned an account representative. Their role is to follow up with the customer and attempt to provide them with additional products and services. 

## New product launch
Contoso is soon going to be launching its new A-300 Series of security equipment. The series has upgraded versions of the A-100 series products. Contoso would like to identify customers who have the A-100 series and would like to create a targeted interactive marketing campaign for them. After an initial email that introduces their new product line, they would like to trigger a series of different interactions based on what the customer does with the email. 

If they open the email and click on of the links, they would like a sales team member to follow up with the customer via phone call.

If the customer does not click on email links, they would like to send another marketing email that provides them with more information about the A-300 Series.
